### Fairy Story
&emsp;&emsp;This is a magical world. I came here, but I don't know why I came here. Similarly, I don't know where I'm going either.
I know nothing about this world. But recently I've felt that, this world was born to me.</br>

&emsp;&emsp;I will follow it, a feeling.</br>

&emsp;&emsp;This feeling maybe a fairy tale in the real world. </br>

&emsp;&emsp;My name is Lin, borning in a place with continuous drizzle. My star sign is Capricornus. Starting from here, 
I will document my journey in the world where I live in. </br>

&emsp;&emsp;Let's begin our magical journey ! ^_^ </br>
</br>
&emsp;&emsp;In our world, there exits many different resources with different quantity and price. We could build any tools 
what we want by them.</br>
